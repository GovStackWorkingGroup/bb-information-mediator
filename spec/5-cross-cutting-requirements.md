# 5 Cross-Cutting Requirements

The cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the [Architecture Blueprint document](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/building-blocks/architecture-and-nonfunctional-requirements) and the [Security BB definition](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/building-blocks/security-requirements). This section will describe any additional cross-cutting requirements that apply to this building block or differences with the Architecture Blueprint.
