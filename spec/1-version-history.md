**Release notes for version 1.1.0** \
This version was developed by the GovStack Information Mediator working group between May and June, 2025. The main purpose of this release is to remove the compulsory requirement of supporting the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. We see from various successful examples of countries that have achieved interoperability in the public sector that it is achievable without the support of the publish-subscribe functionality. However, we strongly recommend to implement publish-subscribe functionality when implementing the Information Mediator solution. In the version 1.2 that we aim to release in Q3 2025, we plan to further review and re-work the publish-subscribe implementation in IM BB. We also plan to focus on developing the implementation guide for the IM BB and reworking the implementation of Service Directory to make use of GovStack Registry BB specification.
